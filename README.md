# Geo-Location-Using-NodeMCU
Geo-Location-Using-NodeMCU is a device that detects the geo-location(latitude,longitude) and accuracy.No GPS module is required.Its very cheap and easy to use.
In our project we used a OLED screen to display the result and used Blynk for mobile popups.The code contains the bluynk and OLED code also.It works on the basic principle of accesing the google api cloud and gets the location.First it takes the WIFI MAC address and then using Google API,MAC address geo location is found and it is fed back to us.


Material Required:
NODEMCU ESP2866
OLED SCREEN
CONNECTING WIRES


Changes to do in the code:
Take a Google API KEY from google and iclude it in the code at googleapikey sppace.Then add the ssid name and password and a email in the blynk part.
You are ready to go.Dump the code into the module and enjoy the fun.
